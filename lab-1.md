# Lab-1
For the lab, please submit a document with urls (one for each problem) to http://cpp.sh with your solution.  On the site there is a button to create a URL.  When your solution is complete (and tested so you verified it is working), click on the make URL link and add that link in your submission.  Your code should include your name, netID and RUID.  


## Problem 1
Modify the code to calculate the average of 4 numbers.

```C
// Example program
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

//takes the average of four numbers
int main()
{
  // complete the code below
  
  cout << "Enter the first number:";
  cout << "Enter the second number:";
  
  average = (a+b+c+d)/n;
  cout << "Average values:" << average;
  return 0;
}

```

## Problem 2
Please complete the program below and in the comments answer the following:  What symbol is the numerical value of 'symbol' that it outputted by the following program if the user enter 'r' 'u' 'p' 'm'?

```C
// Example program
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

//takes the average of four numbers
int main()
{
    // complete the code below
    
    cout << "Enter the first character:";
    cout << "Enter the second character:";
    cout << "Enter the third character:";
    cout << "Enter the fourth character:";
    
    symbol = a+b+c+d;
    cout << "Symbol:" << symbol;
    return 0;
}

```
